![add](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:958/1*16Phh8aWiSgmRilT9o-5Xw.jpeg)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project aims to predict employee salaries based on various features such as experience, education level, job role, and more. The goal is to build a regression model that accurately estimates salary, which can help HR teams and organizations make data-driven compensation decisions.

The workflow is divided into three main stages:
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning** â€“ Handling missing values, formatting, and data type corrections.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Identifying key patterns, trends, and correlations in the data.
3. **Model Building & Prediction** â€“ Using machine learning algorithms to train and evaluate a regression model. The final output includes predictions compared with actual salaries.
